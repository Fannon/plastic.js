LazyLoad Changelog
================================================================================

Version 2.0.3 (2011-07-05)
  * Fixed a bug caused by an unwanted Closure Compiler optimization that broke
    CSS load completion detection in Gecko when using the minified version of
    LazyLoad. [Allex Wang]
  * Fixed a race condition in which a URL could be removed from the "pending"
    queue if it finished loading before other URLs in the same batch had been
    added to the queue, resulting in the queue's length changing unexpectedly
    during iteration. [Klaas Neirinck]

Version 2.0.2 (2011-04-17)
  * Added support for reliable detection of CSS load completion in Gecko
    browsers based on a technique described by Zach Leatherman at
    <http://www.zachleat.com/web/2010/07/29/load-css-dynamically/>.
  * Fixed a bug that prevented CSS load completion from being detected in WebKit
    when there were no other stylesheets on the page. [Klaas Neirinck]
  * Fixed a bug that could prevent CSS callbacks from being called in IE.

Version 2.0.1 (2011-03-05)
  * Added support for async=false. This ensures that parallel script loading
    still works in Firefox 4 while preserving execution order. For more info,
    see <http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Dynamic_Script_Execution_Order>.
  * Stylesheet load completion is now detected reliably in WebKit by polling
    document.styleSheets for changes. Thanks to Jonathan Cook for suggesting
    this solution.
  * Dynamically created script and link nodes are now given a "lazyload" class
    so they can be identified later.
  * The charset for dynamically created script and link nodes is set to "utf-8".

Version 2.0.0 (2009-08-06)
  * Added support for CSS. Caveat: Gecko and WebKit don't support the onload
    event for link nodes, so the CSS callback will fire almost immediately in
    those browsers.
  * When an array of URLs is specified, the resources will be loaded in parallel
    in browsers that support it. Currently, all browsers support loading CSS in
    parallel, but only Gecko and Opera support parallel scripts while preserving
    execution order. 
  * The load() method has been replaced by css() and js() methods for loading
    CSS and JS, respectively.
  * The loadOnce() method has been removed, since it wasn't terribly useful.
  * Improved reliability in all supported browsers.

Version 1.0.4 (2008-07-24)
  * Improved reliability with all supported browsers.
  * Reduced the minified size to 1751 bytes (a whopping 67 bytes smaller than
    version 1.0.3).
  * Fixed a bug that caused the load completion callback to fire immediately in
    Safari 3.x.
  * Fixed a bug that caused the load completion callback to fail to fire in
    Internet Explorer if the script was loaded from the cache.

Version 1.0.3 (2007-06-18)
  * Added "force" parameter to the loadOnce() method to force execution of the
    callback even when all specified scripts have already been loaded.

Version 1.0.2 (2007-06-02)
  * Improved browser detection.
  * Switched to NaturalDocs for source documentation.

Version 1.0.1 (2007-05-30)
  * Fixed potential race condition when load() is called multiple times in
    succession.
  * Refactored to reduce complexity.

Version 1.0.0 (2007-05-29)
  * First release.
